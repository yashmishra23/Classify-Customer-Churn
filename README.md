📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using various machine learning classification algorithms. Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers by identifying individuals who are likely to leave the service.

📌 Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customer retention is critical. Churn — the loss of a customer — directly impacts revenue. This project uses customer demographic and service usage data to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn (1) or not churn (0).
